<h2>About this podcast</h2>
<p>This podcast is a work-in-progress. What does a "hard problem" mean and who should we interview? What are the important questions to ask our guests? How can we bring attention to the problems and people who matter most? Give us your feedback and help us make this into a special project.</p>
