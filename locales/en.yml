  whatQ: "What is Simple?"
  whatA: "In many places, patient records for blood pressure measurements are unusable for tracking patients over time. A simple, focused tracking system, coupled with a simple and effective treatment protocol, will help clinicians to save patients' lives."
  
  startQ: "Where did this project start?"
  startA: "Simple is supported by <a href=\"https://www.resolvetosavelives.org\">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, an initiative of the not-for-profit <a href=\"https://www.vitalstrategies.org/\">Vital Strategies</a>, which aims to reduce the number of people dying from heart disease and stroke in low- and middle-income countries. A key goal is to dramatically increase the number of people with hypertension who have their blood pressure measured and controlled. Simple, contextual digital platforms for tracking hypertension are essential, enabling actionable reporting and improved patient management."
  
  roadmapQ: "What’s the roadmap?"
  roadmapA: "This project is at an early stage. Prototypes of an app were tested in India with the <a href=\"http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=173938\">India Hypertension Management Initiative</a> (IHMI) in April 2018 and we are close to testing a minimum viable product in the field in July."
  roadmapB: "We can envision a future where, working closely with ministries of health, in appropriate situations this app will be used in clinical care settings. Robust reporting tools will be built to track clinic and regional control of hypertension. And we are likely to create tools to help patients track their personal blood pressures. That said, it’s early days and we will be guided by lessons learned on the ground and by guidance from all of those involved in the project."

  principlesQ: "What are our principles?"
  principlesA: "We have one overarching goal: save lives. This project will always be open source (<a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\">MIT license</a>), free, and open to contributions from everyone. We endorse the <a href=\"https://digitalprinciples.org/\">Principles for Digital Development</a>. We will seek to embody the concepts of the Digital Principles, which are represented in our work culture and in the policies and processes guiding our international development activities."
  
  freeQ: "Is Simple really free?"
  free1: "Simple is truly free to use."
  free2: "Use the code in any way."
  free3: "It will never cost money."
  freeA: "This project is supported by <a href=\"https://www.resolvetosavelives.org\">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, an initiative of the not-for-profit <a href=\"https://www.vitalstrategies.org/\">Vital Strategies</a>, which enables us to provide this software completely free of cost with no strings attached."
  
  techQ: "What is Simple built with?"
  techA: "The Android app is written in <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/\">Kotlin</a>. The API is written in <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a>. Clinical data is <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/\">FHIR</a> compliant. Thanks for asking, fellow geeks!"
  
  teamQ: "Who contributes to this project?"
  teamA: "This is an open source project with contributions from clinicians, designers, developers, and technologists. Some of the early contributors include:"
  
  ossQ: "Is Simple starting an open source community?"
  ossA: "Yes. We are looking forward to establishing an open source community that includes designers, developers, implementers, healthcare workers, and patients. More information will be coming through this year. In the meantime, GitHub is the center for contributions. We are doing one piece of open source contribution right now: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dburka/open-source-identity-design-for-simple-4025c6d48acc\">Help us design the brand?</a>."

  thanksQ: "Thank you"
  thanksA: "This project relies on excellent advice and participation from the partners of Resolve to Save Lives, the Government of India, the Government of Punjab, and countless clinical workers, patients, and colleagues who put in the hard work every day to improve the control of hypertension around the world."
  
  moreQ: "Where can I learn more?"
  moreA: "There is a lot more about the broad project of Resolve to Save Lives' cardiovascular health goals on the website. In the future, we'll add a lot more content here, but to be honest we're not exactly sure where this project will lead."
