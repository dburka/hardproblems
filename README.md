This repository houses the source code for the hardproblems.com website.

## Development

We use [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) to build the static pages which are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To run the site on your own machine, simply clone the repo, install the packages necessary, and start up a Middleman server.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dburka/hardproblems.git
$ cd hardproblems
$ bundle install
$ middleman server
```

Now you should be able to go to http://localhost:4567 and see the site running locally.
